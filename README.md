# drill-odbc-examples
Three examples to connect Drill to ODBC in three different languages:  Python, R and Perl.

These files contain small boilerplate examples to get connected to the driver and run queries.  Note that some setup of the ODBC drivers (for Drill and as a Data Store Name on the system) is required before running, consult the Apache Drill ODBC configuration page for the steps for various operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux).
